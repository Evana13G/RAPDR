 ... Setting up services
 ... Cleaning up data from last run
 ... Setting up initial data

Agent has the following goal: 
['(obtained block)']

Agent will attempt to accomplish this goal. If attempt fails, agent will try
to find new actions and replan with those actions. Process repeats until the 
agent is able to accomplish its goal....
